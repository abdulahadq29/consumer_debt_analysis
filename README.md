# Analyzing the Impact of Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy on Consumer Debt

## Overview

This analysis investigates the relationship between changes in the Bank of Canada's interest rate policy and consumer debt levels in Canada. Using a dataset of quarterly financial flows and stocks of household credit market debt, the impact of short-term interest rates on credit market debt to disposable income is examined. A linear regression model showed an inverse relationship between short-term interest rates and consumer debt levels. This analysis helps us in understanding the role of fiscal tools in shaping consumer financial behavior.
