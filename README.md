# debt

This analysis investigates the relationship between changes in the Bank of
Canadaâ€™s interest rate policy and consumer debt levels in Canada. Using a
dataset of quarterly financial flows and stocks of household credit market debt,
the impact of short-term interest rates on credit market debt to disposable income
is examined. A linear regression model showed an inverse relationship between
short-term interest rates and consumer debt levels. This analysis helps us in
understanding the role of fiscal tools in shaping consumer financial behavior.
